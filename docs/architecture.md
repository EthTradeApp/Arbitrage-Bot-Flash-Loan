# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

The Flash Loan Arbitrage Bot is designed to execute profitable trades across different decentralized exchanges (DEXes) using flash loans. The system is built with modularity, security, and gas efficiency in mind.

## System Architecture

### 1. Smart Contracts Layer

#### Core Contracts
- **FlashLoanArbitrage.sol**
  - Main contract orchestrating the arbitrage process
  - Implements flash loan callback interface
  - Handles token swaps and profit calculations
  - Includes emergency stop functionality
  - Manages owner permissions

#### Interfaces
- **IUniswap.sol**
  - Defines interaction with Uniswap V2/V3
  - Handles token swaps and price queries
  - Implements slippage protection

- **IAave.sol**
  - Defines flash loan functionality
  - Manages loan requests and repayments
  - Handles flash loan premiums

- **ICurve.sol**
  - Defines Curve pool interactions
  - Handles stablecoin swaps
  - Implements price calculations

#### Libraries
- **Math.sol**
  - Provides safe mathematical operations
  - Implements price calculations
  - Handles decimal precision

### 2. Configuration Layer

#### Network Configuration
- Development network settings
- Mainnet and testnet configurations
- Gas price and limit settings
- Network-specific parameters

#### Token Configuration
- Token addresses for different networks
- Supported trading pairs
- Token decimals and precision

### 3. Testing Layer

#### Unit Tests
- Individual contract function tests
- Mathematical calculation verification
- Permission and access control tests
- Edge case handling

#### Integration Tests
- Complete arbitrage flow testing
- Cross-contract interaction verification
- Gas usage optimization
- Error handling scenarios

## Workflow

### 1. Price Monitoring
- Continuous price monitoring across DEXes
- Price difference calculation
- Opportunity identification
- Gas cost consideration

### 2. Flash Loan Execution
- Loan amount calculation
- Protocol selection (Aave)
- Loan request and callback
- Repayment verification

### 3. Arbitrage Execution
- Token swap on first DEX
- Price verification
- Token swap on second DEX
- Profit calculation

### 4. Profit Management
- Profit verification
- Token withdrawal
- Gas cost deduction
- Performance tracking

## Security Measures

### 1. Flash Loan Safety
- Repayment verification
- Transaction atomicity
- Error handling
- Emergency stop functionality

### 2. Price Manipulation Protection
- Slippage protection
- Price oracle integration
- Minimum profit thresholds
- Transaction deadline

### 3. Access Control
- Owner-only functions
- Emergency stop capability
- Withdrawal limits
- Parameter validation

## Gas Optimization

### 1. Contract Optimization
- Efficient data structures
- Minimal storage usage
- Optimized function calls
- Batch operations

### 2. Transaction Optimization
- Gas price monitoring
- Transaction timing
- Batch processing
- Failed transaction handling

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Performance Monitoring
